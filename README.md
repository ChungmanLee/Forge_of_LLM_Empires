## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a **database structure** with sample datasets for **ChainForge**, a platform for managing and analyzing workflows that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs). The database is designed to store and monitor LLM usage in ChainForge while also providing functionality to save and view workflow-related data.

---

## Data Generation

The data for this project was generated using Python scripts to simulate realistic usage scenarios in ChainForge. Below is a summary of the generated dataset:

- **Users & Workflows**:
  - **50 users** were created, each assigned to a single workflow (1:1 relationship).
- **Nodes**:
  - Workflows contain **2 to 30 nodes**, randomly generated based on the workflow's nature, totaling **777 nodes**.
  - **Node_Links**: 632 links describe the communication between nodes, respecting type-based constraints (e.g., not all nodes can be source or target nodes).
- **LLM Models**:
  - **16 LLMs** available for use in ChainForge workflows were included.
- **LLM APIs**:
  - Each workflow has **0 to 3 API keys**, resulting in **77 API keys** across the dataset.
- **Node LLM Models**:
  - Generated for **prompt nodes** and **LLM evaluator nodes**, with **95 entries** in total.
- **Results**:
  - Each node has **1 to 5 results**, totaling **2311 results** stored in the database.

## Purpose

This database is designed to achieve the following goals:

1. **Track LLM Usage**: Monitor the utilization of various LLMs across ChainForge workflows.
2. **Store Workflow Data**: Save detailed information about users, workflows, nodes, and their interactions.

## Database Structure

The database consists of the following tables:

1. **Users**: Stores user details.
2. **LLM_Models**: Contains information about available LLMs in ChainForge.
3. **LLM_API**: Stores API keys associated with each user.
4. **Workflows**: Represents workflows used by the users.
5. **Nodes**: Contains nodes generated within workflows.
6. **Node_Type**: Defines the types of nodes available.
7. **Node_Links**: Tracks communication between nodes.
8. **Node_LLM_Models**: Maps nodes to the LLMs they utilize.
9. **Node_Results**: Stores the results generated by nodes.
